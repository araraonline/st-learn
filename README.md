Hey there!

This is a repository used specifically for learning.

By now, I will be following the exercises proposed by Adrian Neumann here:

https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

Later on, I can start adding more challenges.

The focus language is Smalltalk (specifically [GNU Smalltalk][1]. I hope to get
some insight in object-oriented programming along with it (also, they say it
is a pretty fun language).
